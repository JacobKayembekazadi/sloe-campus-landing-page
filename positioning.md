**Secondary:** "Designed for people who want a concrete AI skill and a live build, not another theory course."

## The Three Skill Paths

### 1. Shopify AI Store Builder (Beginner Friendly)

**What they learn:** Use an AI assistant (Google Gemini) to help plan products and write content, then turn that into a simple online store. They use a website editor (Shopify) to design the store and a code helper (Cursor) plus GitHub to safely save and update their theme.

**Outcome to promise:** "By the end, you have a basic but real Shopify store online, with products, pages, and a simple design you can show to potential customers or local businesses."

**7-Day Breakdown:**
- **Days 1-2:** Pick a simple store idea (real or practice), use an AI assistant (Gemini) to help you brainstorm products, write basic product descriptions, and outline your pages (home, about, contact).
- **Days 3-4:** Use Shopify's visual editor to put those pages and products into a real store, and use a code helper (Cursor) plus GitHub in the background so any changes are saved safely and can be rolled back if needed.
- **Days 5-7:** Clean up the design using inspiration from Pinterest, connect basic settings (payments, shipping templates), and make the store live so it has a real URL you can send to others or show to businesses.

### 2. AI Internal Tools for Local Businesses

**What they learn:** Use Gemini and AI Studio to plan out a small tool, then use simple web technology (Cursor + GitHub + a host like Vercel) to build a dashboard that connects to spreadsheets or simple databases.

**Example projects:**
- **Real estate:** A lead-tracking dashboard that pulls in new leads from a spreadsheet and helps the agent see who to follow up with this week.
- **Lawyers:** An intake + document-summary helper that stores client intakes in a sheet and generates quick summaries to paste into their case system.
- **Local service businesses (plumbers, salons, etc.):** A simple "jobs tracker" that logs jobs, status, and key notes, and sends a reminder when follow-ups are due.

**Outcome to promise:** "By the end, you have a small, working internal tool that solves a real tracking or admin problem for a local business, powered by AI but understandable to a non-technical owner."

**7-Day Breakdown:**
- **Days 1-2:** Choose a simple problem for a common business, like a real estate agent tracking leads or a lawyer tracking new client intakes, then use an AI assistant to help you sketch what the tool should do and what data it needs.
- **Days 3-4:** Build a very simple web dashboard using a code editor (Cursor), store the code on GitHub, and connect it to something familiar like Google Sheets or Airtable so the business can see and update their data.
- **Days 5-7:** Add one or two small "smart" features (like reminders, summaries, or filters), host the tool on a beginner-friendly platform like Vercel so it has a live link, and document how a real estate agent or lawyer would use it in their week.

### 3. AI-Powered Website in 7 Days

**What they learn:** Use Gemini to plan the pages and write draft copy, use Pinterest for design ideas, then build and launch the site using Cursor, GitHub, and Vercel (a simple hosting platform for websites).

**Outcome options:**
- A clean, basic website for a local business (for example, a three-page site for a realtor, lawyer, or cafe).
- A "smart" site where forms or buttons trigger automations in the background using tools like n8n or Zapier (for example, a contact form that logs leads in a sheet and sends an automatic response).

**Outcome to promise:** "By the end, you have a live website on its own link that you can send to clients or add to your portfolio."

**7-Day Breakdown:**
- **Days 1-2:** Pick a business type (for example, a realtor, lawyer, café, or personal brand), use an AI assistant to plan the key pages and write draft copy, and collect simple design inspiration from Pinterest.
- **Days 3-4:** Use a code editor (Cursor) to turn that plan into a real site, save the code on GitHub, and deploy it to Vercel so the website is live and reachable on the web.
- **Days 5-7:** Polish the design, then optionally connect a form or button to an automation tool (like n8n or Zapier) so leads get saved into a sheet and trigger automatic follow-ups, turning it from a static site into a simple "smart" site.

## Landing Page Strategy

### Hero Section
- **Primary CTA:** "Join the Campus" (links to checkout)
- **Secondary CTA:** "Get the 7‑Day AI Skill Map (Free)" (triggers lead magnet modal)

### Lead Magnet
- **Name:** "7-Day AI Skill Map"
- **Format:** PDF or mini-email series
- **Purpose:** Outline what a week of focused building looks like, so even cold traffic can start a relationship before buying

### Nurture and Proof
- **Email:** 3–5 email sequence sharing quick wins, screenshots of student builds, and breakdowns like "How this simple AI OS became a $1.5k project for a local business."
- **Social:** Continue "build-in-public" content and mini-tutorials that invite viewers to either grab the 7-Day map or join the Campus for guided implementation.

### Core Offer Entry Points
1. **Direct purchase:** From landing page with clean, low-friction checkout into Sloe AI Campus ($49/month)
2. **Live session/webinar (optional):** Recurring "7‑Day AI Skill Sprint Orientation" call (30 minutes, show 2–3 project examples, pitch Campus at end)

## Onboarding Experience

**Day 0–1:** Simple onboarding—pick 1 monetizable skill (AI OS, AI website, AI research tool), watch a 20–30 minute "start here" video, and join the community.

**Days 2–7:** Guided 7-day track (daily checklist/messages): learn core skill → implement → deploy live → package it into a simple offer (one-page pitch, pricing, outreach script). This turns the marketing promise into a concrete, repeatable experience.

## Key Messaging Principles

1. **Focus on ONE skill** - Not overwhelming with multiple paths at once
2. **Emphasize LIVE project** - Not just learning, but shipping
3. **Target non-technical** - Make it accessible, not intimidating
4. **7-day timeframe** - Specific, achievable, creates urgency
5. **Monetizable outcome** - Clear path to making money with the skill
6. **Stop watching, start building** - Action-oriented, not passive learning
